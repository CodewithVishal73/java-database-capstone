# Schema Architecture for Online Smart Clinic Management System

## 1. Architecture Summary

The **Online Smart Clinic Management System** is designed using a multi-tier architecture that separates the presentation, business logic, and data layers. This architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and security.

- **Frontend (Presentation Layer)**:  
  Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing intuitive interfaces for patients, doctors, and administrators. It handles user inputs, form validations, and user interactions.

- **Backend (Business Logic Layer)**:  
  Built with **Java** using the **Spring Boot framework**, which manages business logic, application services, and RESTful APIs. It handles appointment scheduling, user authentication, medical records management, and other core functionalities.

- **Database (Data Layer)**:  
  Utilizes **MySQL** as the relational database to store and manage clinic data, including patient records, appointment details, prescriptions, and billing information. The database is designed with proper normalization and indexing for performance and data integrity.

- **Security**:  
  User authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) are implemented to ensure secure access to sensitive data. Encrypted communication and password hashing techniques are used.

This architecture supports seamless and secure online clinic operations.

## sec2. Data Flow and Control Steps

1. A user (patient/doctor/admin) submits a request via the web interface.  
2. The frontend captures the input and sends it to the backend RESTful API.  
3. The backend validates the request and applies business logic.  
4. If needed, the backend queries or updates the database (MySQL).  
5. The database returns data to the backend.  
6. The backend processes the response and sends it back to the frontend.  
7. The frontend displays the updated information to the user.
